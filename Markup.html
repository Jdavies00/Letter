    <p>
      Dear Eileen,</p>
      <p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your PHD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p>
    <h2>
      Starting dates
    </h2>
    <p>
      We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>First Semester: 9 September 2016</li> <!-- should these have the date time tag? -->
      <li>Second Semester: 15 January 2017</li>
      <li>Third Semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Please let me know what start dates you would prefer
    </p>
